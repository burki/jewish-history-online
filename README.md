Web-site http://jewish-history-online.net/
==========================================

This is the code base for the presentation of the site. The generic parts
are factored out into a Symfony bundle:
    https://github.com/igdj/tei-edition-bundle

You can find a demo edition which demonstrates the use of that bundle
including step-by-step setup instructions at
    https://github.com/igdj/demo-edition

You may use or adjust code from this project if it fits your needs.
