==========================================

This is the code base for the presentation of the site. Since certain
assumptions concerning the bilingual presentation of all the content (de / en)
[TODO: Develop a language strategy] or the set of licenses used are currently hardwired,
this code is not yet intended for out-of-the-box re-use by other projects.

You may use it in parts or adjust it to your own need if it fits your needs.
If you have any questions or find this code helpful, please contact us at
